  <![CDATA[<p>
    A 3rd party class which has been deprecated is being used here. Refactor the code to remove references to any deprecated class(es).
    <p>
    The @Deprecated annotation exists to allow you to mark code as retired. This is applicable when you have control over the code, and are able
    to add the annotation where and when you choose. However, if you decide that you wish to deprecate code which you have no control over (i.e. 
    3rd party code) the @Deprecated annotation cannot be used. This FindBugs plugin allows you to specify 3rd party code which is deprecated, 
    and report on uses of such code.
